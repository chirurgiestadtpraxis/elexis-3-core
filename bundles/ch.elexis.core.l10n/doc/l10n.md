# Localisation / translation

For a background see http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseInternationalization and consider that most Elexis plugins are still Eclipse 3 based.

## How to add a message

* Create a Messages.java if necessary
* Create in the new Messages.java a new constant (which will forward to the central Messages.java) by adding line like 

    static string Messages.MY_NEW_MESSAGE = ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.MY_NEW_MESSAGE
    
* Create a first entry for it in ch.elexis.core.l10n/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/messages.properties
* Add more entries for each language either
** my manually editing  ch.elexis.core.l10n.[lang]/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/messages_[lang].properties
** or use the script ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb and call it 
*** ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-csv
*** ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --add-missing=[lang[
*** ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-properties

* It is the release managers duty to call the last three lines before publishing a new release to ensure that we have uptodate translation
* We strive to have a person responsible for each language to correct the google translation and ensure a high quality

## Why we place everything into one file

* When starting up we see clearly which messages or used or missing.
* Using constants in Messages.java make searching for occurrences much easier
* It is easier to detect/correct spelling differences/replacing one word by another

## Task list for Elexis 3.4 -> 3.5 french translation

### Howto migrate a single Messages.java which extends NLS

* Add a dependency (if needed) to ch.elexis.core.l10n in the MANIFEST.MF
* Check the feature.xml to ensure that ch.elexis.core.l10n gets included, too
* Edit the Messages.java file
	* change the to to look like
	   package ch.elexis.core.ui;
	    public class Messages  {
	    };	
	* copy all String xy = ; to ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.java
	* Remove line containing "BUNDLE_NAME"
	* replace all strings "String (.*);" using a regular expression with "String \1 = ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.\1;"
* Remove the message*.properties files

### Before committing the changes

* Sort the string constants in ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.java

### Howto migrate a single Messages.java using  java.util.ResourceBundle

* Add a dependency (if needed) to ch.elexis.core.l10n in the MANIFEST.MF
* Check the feature.xml to ensure that ch.elexis.core.l10n gets included, too
* Replace the Messages.java with an empty declaration like

	   package ch.rgw.utility;
	    public class Messages  {
	    };	
 
* Build the project 
* For each failing replace (using regular expression `Messages.getString\("(.*)\.(.*)"\)`  by `Messages.\1_\2`
* Using Eclipse IDE add  each non declared constant to Messages.java
* Remove `= null` and `final` in the Message.java
* continue as with described in point "Howto migrate a single Messages.java which extends NLS"

### The individual tasks

* *Done:* Use the ruby `script ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb` to populate missing french/italian translations via google translations
* *Done:* Convert the 37 (of 162 Messages.java file elexis (core, base,gpl)) which have still the old format to the new format, eg.
  ch.elexis.core.data.util/Messages.java which extend org.eclipse.osgi.util.NLS or import java.util.ResourceBundle
* *Done:* Wait till elexis-3-core/base are converted to the pomless tycho build (as this will move all java files into another subdirectory)
* *Done:* for each Messages.java we redirect all constants to ch.elexis.core.l10n
* The archie plugin has to be treated manually, as the translation is handled somehow differently
* the repository elexis-gpl will only be touched AFTER we merge Joerg sigles changes into 3.5
* Translations which are done via plugin*.properties and similar files, are done manually
* Verify manually the translation
	* If possible use the Jubula GUI tests and examine all generated screenshots
	* Create a dictionary with important translations for common concepts and place it into the elexis-3-core
* *To be decided*: Should we move each language as a separate bundle
* *To be decided*: Should these separate bundes read a CSV (or similar) file to enable clients to update their translation by themselves
	* In favor: Turnaround is fast
	* Against: Changes will not be reported back
	* Against: More work
	
* *Done:* Modified EigenartikelTyp, ICondition, etc which call directly ResourceBundle.getBundle("ch.elexis.core.findings.messages") like this
	* ResourceBundle.getBundle(ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.BUNDLE_NAME)
	* Join `getSimpleName()` and `this.name()` with `'_'` and not `'.'`

## Watch for missing/superfluos definitions

* Missing/superfluos translations are flagged when starting the application/loading a plugin, watch them
* Moving/Changing the Messages.java creates problems when merging changes from one branch to another

# Working with the translations.csv

The concerned files are:
    * Messages.java and messages*.properties which are the old source
    * A database elexis-translation my home directory, which is saved as a yaml file (for readability) and as a SQLlite3 databese (for SQL-queries)
    * Outputs as google_translation_cache.yaml/CSV  to be given to translaters (if a csv file exists, the yaml file will be ignored)

To be able to use the google translation, the environment variable TRANSLATE_API_KEY must be defined

The workflow was the following

* Parse all the Messages.java and import them into the database ($HOME/elexis-translation.db) using

    ../elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --parse-messsage bundles/

* Add missing translations, must be called for each language, eg, fr or it. Creates or updates $HOME/google_translation_cache.[csv|yaml]

    ../elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --add-missing fr
      Initialized for 0 directories
      We want to translate 6758 items for de
      Translating Angegebener Kontakt nicht vorhanden found 1 was Angegebener Kontakt nicht vorhanden
      <...>
      Saving 7442 entries to /home/niklaus/google_translation_cache.yaml

* Generate a new trema file

      ../elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --gen-trema
      Please report a bug if this causes problems.
      Initialized for 0 directories
      Generated /home/niklaus/trema.trm with 20381 nr_msgs

* Copy the updated trema.trm into the l10n directory, generate the properties, eg.

      cp /home/niklaus/trema.trm ./bundles/ch.elexis.base.l10n/rsc/texts.trm
      mvn clean process-sources
      git add ./bundles/ch.elexis.base.l10n

### Work to todo with i18n_gen_info.rb

* *Done:* We should no longer generate a texts.trm for each plugin, only for the l10n project
* For this project we should emit only
* Instead of generating a plugin.trm we should directly generate the plugin_[lang].properties file
